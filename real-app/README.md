# Android with Kotlin

This folder contains the code of a reasonably real application
implemented in the language.

A basic android app has been created to show how one would setup an Android project. There are multiple activities that pass information between each other. Many of the basic Android functions have been used. Notice how little code is required for the functionality produced.

To open and view the code, open the folder `lab03` in Android Studio.
